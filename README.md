# Tech Sales Analysis

##  About the Project  
This project explores sales data from a technology products company, covering 461 transactions made throughout 2021. The aim was to identify trends across product categories, regions, time periods, and sales team performance to support business decisions and strategic planning.

The analysis was conducted in **Excel** using pivot tables, charts, and basic calculations. The dataset includes total sales figures for each transaction, broken down by product type, salesperson, region, and quarter.

##  Key Steps in Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Ensured consistency in naming conventions (e.g., salesperson names, product categories).  
   - Handled missing or duplicate entries where necessary.  
   - Standardised date formats for accurate monthly and quarterly comparisons.

2. **Sales Performance by Salesperson**  
   - Used pivot tables to aggregate sales figures by salesperson.  
   - Identified top and bottom performers based on total sales.  
   - Analysed monthly trends to detect seasonal performance variations.

3. **Product Performance Analysis**  
   - Grouped sales by product categories (e.g., Laptops, Cameras, Printers).  
   - Identified best-selling and least-selling products.  
   - Compared revenue contributions across different product lines.

4. **Monthly & Quarterly Sales Trends**  
   - Tracked sales performance across months to identify peak and off-peak periods.  
   - Analysed quarterly trends to assess business cycles and seasonal impacts.

5. **Regional Sales Insights**  
   - Mapped sales data by region to identify high-performing and underperforming areas.  
   - Compared regional sales trends to optimise resource allocation.

## Key Questions  

- Which product categories generated the most revenue?  
- How did sales vary across quarters?  
- Which regions performed best?  
- What patterns exist in individual salesperson performance?  
- Are there seasonal trends in specific product categories?

## Summary of Findings  

- **Computers** were the top-performing product category, contributing over 29% of total sales. Cameras & Phones and Audio-Video followed closely. Together, the top three categories made up more than 80% of overall revenue.
  
- **Q2** was the best-performing quarter, suggesting effective seasonal promotions or product launches. Sales dipped slightly in Q3 and Q4, indicating potential missed opportunities during peak shopping seasons.

- The **Midwest** region achieved the highest sales, with the West and Southeast following closely. The **Southwest** underperformed significantly, revealing an opportunity for targeted regional strategies.

- A small group of salespeople — *Austin, Anderson, and Watson* — were responsible for nearly half of the company’s total revenue. The bottom quartile of the sales team contributed less than 10%, highlighting a considerable performance gap.

- Category-level analysis by quarter revealed that **Computer sales peaked in Q2 and Q4**, while **Game Consoles surged in Q4**, likely due to holiday demand. **Cameras and Phones peaked in Q3**, and **Audio-Video products maintained steady performance** throughout the year.

## Recommendations  

- **Prioritise high-performing categories**: Focus marketing and inventory planning on Computers, Cameras & Phones, and Audio-Video products.

- **Address regional gaps**: Implement targeted initiatives in the Southwest to bring performance in line with other regions.

- **Prepare for seasonal peaks**: Align stock and staffing levels with high-demand periods such as Q2 and Q4.

- **Support the sales team**: Develop mentorship or training programmes that allow top performers to share successful strategies with lower-performing colleagues.

- **Review underperforming categories**: Reassess whether continued investment in categories like Printers is justified.
